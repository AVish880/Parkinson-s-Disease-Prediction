## Introduction
Parkinson's Disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that primarily affects movement. Early detection can significantly improve the quality of life for affected individuals. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in vocal features that may indicate the presence of Parkinson's Disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Parkinson's dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons) available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 195 samples with 24 features extracted from voice recordings.

### Key Features:
- Vocal frequency measurements (e.g., `MDVP:Fo(Hz)`, `MDVP:Fhi(Hz)`)
- Jitter and shimmer features representing variations in voice amplitude and frequency
- Harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR)
- Status: Indicates whether a subject has Parkinson's Disease (`1`) or not (`0`)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset and performed an exploratory analysis to understand its structure and features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values.
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler` for improved model performance.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's accuracy and fine-tuned it for better performance.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive accuracy of XX% on the test data.
- **Insights**: Certain features, such as jitter and shimmer values, proved to be highly indicative of Parkinson's Disease.
